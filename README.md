# Echelon2.0_AgForecast
🥈 Runner Up at Echelon 2.0! 🥈
I am beyond excited to share that our team, 4 TABAAHI, secured the Runner Up position at the Echelon 2.0 hackathon! 🏆

For this challenge, we tackled the high-stakes Silver Prediction Market. Silver is a notoriously difficult asset to analyze due to its dual identity: it is both a precious metal and a critical industrial commodity. Traditional analysis often fails to capture the chaotic interplay between macroeconomic shifts, industrial supply deficits, and the "noise" of social media sentiment.

Our solution? An end-to-end automated intelligence pipeline powered by our Narrative Detection Agent (aka the Autonomous Pattern Hunter).

🧠 The Core Innovation: The Pattern Hunter
Our agent doesn't just read data; it understands market evolution:
Autonomous Scanning: It continuously monitors data streams for emerging market narratives.
Unsupervised Clustering: It identifies topics without predefined categories, allowing it to adapt to "black swan" events.
Noise Filtration: It distinguishes between "coherent narratives" and random market chatter.
Dynamic Management: The agent names new narratives and merges or splits them as trends evolve.

🛠️ Overcoming the Technical Hurdle
The biggest challenge wasn't just building the intelligence—it was deployment. Moving a complex architecture involving a Streamlit frontend, n8n workflow orchestration, and Google Vertex AI into a stable, live environment was a massive undertaking. We successfully navigated the complexities of integrating multiple APIs (Yahoo Finance, FRED, SerpAPI) and ensuring real-time webhook responsiveness under pressure.

🤝 The Team
This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the incredible synergy of Team 4 TABAAHI:
Shreejit Nikam
Gauravi Prajapati
Swarnim Ninawe

A huge thank you to the organizers of Echelon 2.0 for a fantastic experience. We’re walking away with a trophy, but more importantly, a proven architecture for navigating volatile markets.
